					<ul class="bookDetails">
						<li class="bookDesc">
						Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people to walk on Mars. Now, he’s sure he’ll be the first person to die there.<br><br></li>
						<li class="bookBlurb">
						I'm stranded on Mars.<br>
						I have no way to communicate with Earth.<br>
						I'm in a habitat designed to last 31 days.<br>
						If the oxygenator breaks down, I'll suffocate. If the water reclaimer breaks down, I'll die of thirst. If the hab breaches, I'll just kind of explode. If none of those things happen, I'll eventually run out of food and starve to death.<br>
						So yeah. I'm screwed.<br><br></li>

						But when Wade stumbles upon the first clue, he finds himself beset by players willing to kill to take this ultimate prize. The race is on, and if Wade's going to survive, he'll have to win—and confront the real world he's always been so desperate to escape.<br><br></li>
